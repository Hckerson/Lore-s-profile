            Hello, sir My name is Akingbade Diekoloreoluwa I am seventeen years old, and I was born and raised in Ibadan , and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you. <br>

        I've always been a curious soul, born and raised in Ibadan. From a young age, I found joy in exploring my surroundings, asking questions, and seeking answers. <br> My family and teachers quickly noticed my love for learning and encouraged me to pursue my interests with passion and dedication.

        In school, I thrived academically, earning top grades and engaging actively in class discussions. <br> I was always eager to share my insights and perspectives with my peers, and I cherished the opportunity to learn from others as well.

        Beyond academics, I embraced a diverse range of interests, including sports, music, and church services.
